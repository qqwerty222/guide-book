## Basic commands

- [[#^d18198|Check connection to hostname]]
- [[#^1484e1|Ping several times]]
- [[#^57a302|Ping in broadcast mode]]

- ###  Ping hostname ^d18198
	- Each row of input include: 
		- size of the packet
		- hostname 
		- ip address 
		- number of packet and time of response

	 - At the end you can see detailed statistic include: 
		- how many packets sended 
		- how many packets received
		- percent of packets that didn't returned
		- total time
```
bohdan@test-host:~$ ping ns1.testdomain.com

```

- ### Ping several times ^1484e1
	- -c means count
```
bohdan@test-host:~$ ping -c 5 10.0.2.6
PING 10.0.2.6 (10.0.2.6) 56(84) bytes of data.

```

- ### Ping in broadcast mode ^57a302
	- -b enable broadcast

Firstly disable broadcast ignoring. You need to do this on all of target machines.
```
bohdan@test-dns:~$ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=0
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 0
```

Next try broadcast again.  255.255.255.255 is a special address that means everyone.
```
bohdan@test-host:~$ ping -b 255.255.255.255
WARNING: pinging broadcast address
PING 255.255.255.255 (255.255.255.255) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.0.2.5: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.017 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.2.6: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.662 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.2.15: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.662 ms
```
As you can see I got output from 3 machines, Host(my current machine), DNS and Nginx.
